Blendr is a terminal UI app for browsing BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices. It allows you to inspect, search, connect, and analyze data coming from BLE devices directly from your terminal.

It was designed for day-to-day use by BLE engineers so the core features are **useful search**, direct connection to any characteristic and device with **one command**, and displaying **your custom services names** in the UI. [Learn more](#usage)

## Prerequisits 

### MacOS

To use Bluetooth on MacOS Big Sur (11) or later, you need to either package your binary into an application bundle with an Info.plist including NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription, or (for a command-line application such as the examples included with btleplug) enable the Bluetooth permission for your terminal. You can do the latter by going to System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy â†’ Privacy â†’ Bluetooth, clicking the '+' button, and selecting 'Terminal' (or iTerm or whichever terminal application you use).
